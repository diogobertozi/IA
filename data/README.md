# Dataset Documentation

## Dataset Source
The primary dataset used in this project is the Iris dataset, which is available through the scikit-learn library. Additionally, a second dataset will be selected from UCI, OpenML, or Kaggle to complement the analysis.

## Dataset Structure
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, each with 4 features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

Each sample is classified into one of three species of Iris flowers:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

The second dataset will vary based on the selection but will be structured similarly, containing multiple features and a target variable for classification (if applicable).

## Relevant Information
- The datasets will be pre-processed to handle any missing values and normalized to ensure that all features contribute equally to the clustering algorithms.
- The clustering analysis will be performed without using the actual labels during the clustering process, with labels being used only for evaluation purposes after clustering.

## Usage
This documentation serves as a guide for understanding the datasets used in the clustering analysis. Ensure that the datasets are properly loaded and pre-processed before applying the clustering algorithms.
